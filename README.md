# Breakdance QuickNav

![Breakdance QuickNav plugin in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deckerweb/breakdance-quicknav/master/assets-github/breakdance-quicknav-screenshot.png)

The **Breakdance QuickNav** plugin adds a quick-access navigator to the WordPress Admin Bar (Toolbar). It allows easy access to Breakdance Builder Templates, Headers, Footers, Global Blocks, Popups, and (regular WordPress) Pages edited with Breakdance, along with other essential settings.

### Tested Compatibility
- **Breakdance**: 2.3.0+ / 2.4.1 Beta
- **Headspin Copilot**: 1.4.1
- **WPSix Exporter**: 1.0.8
- **Yabe Webfont** 1.0.70 / 2.0.70
- **WordPress**: 6.7.2
- **PHP**: 8.3+

_Note:_ This plugin was originally developed by [Peter KulcsÃ¡r](https://github.com/beamkiller) under the name ["Breakdance Navigator"](https://github.com/beamkiller/breakdance-navigator). Since it is licensed GPL v2 or later, I decided to fork it to add some more/other links and tweak some things. â€“ If you like the original version, fine! Use it and support the original author!

## Differences

**What Does "Breakdance QuickNav" _Different_ than "Breakdance Navigator"?**

### 1) Intended usage for Administrator users only!
Therefore the default capability to see the new Admin Bar node is set to `activate_plugins`. You can change this via the constant `BDQN_VIEW_CAPABILITY` â€“ define that via wp-config.php or via a Code Snippet plugin: `define( 'BDQN_VIEW_CAPABILITY', 'edit_posts' );`

### 2) Shorter name of main menu item in Admin Bar, just named "BD".
This is way shorter than "Breakdance Nav" and takes much less of the precious space there. However, if you don't enjoy "BD" you can tweak that also via the constant `BDQN_NAME_IN_ADMINBAR` â€“ define that also via wp-config.php or via a Code Snippet plugin: `define( 'BDQN_NAME_IN_ADMINBAR', 'BD Nav' );`

### 3) Default icon of main menu item pulled directly from Breakdance plugin.
The yellow default logo icon is awesome but a bit too yellow-ish for my taste â€“ at least within the Admin Bar. Therefore I pull in the builder icon intended for dark mode (light logo on dark background). If that is not there for whatever reason it pulls in Peter's yellow icon (in local plugin folder). You can also tweak that via a constant in wp-config.php oder via a Code Snippets plugin: `define( 'BDQN_ICON', 'yellow' );`

### 4) Increased plugin support.
The supported plugins are increased compared to Peters original plugin. The "WPSix Exporter" is now supported by default. All supported plugins are checked if they are active or not.
_Please note:_ I will ONLY add support for direct Breakdance add-on plugins. And I can only add support if I would own a license myself (for testing etc.). Therefore if there might be Breakdance plugins you want me to add integration for, please open an issue on the plugin page on GitHub so we might discuss that. (Thanks in advance!)

### 5) Disable footer items (Links & About)
To disable these menu items, just use another constant in wp-config.php or via a Code Snippets plugin: `define( 'BDQN_DISABLE_FOOTER', 'yes' );`

### 6) Updated links.
I carefully updated the links from the Breakdance community, including plugin/ library/ tutorial sites.

### 7) Other tweaks.
a) There is another check for Breakdance plugin itself: if no Breakdance active then the whole Admin Bar addition is NOT loaded and displayed. Makes sense.
b) If for whatever reason you have already "Breakdance Navigator" installed and ACTIVATED, my plugin (Breakdance QuickNav) will not display anything (even if activated). So it makes sense you decide for one or the other ... ðŸ™‚

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is. I have no intention to add support for every little detail / third-party plugin / library etc. Its main focus is support for the template types and Breakdance settings. Plugin support is added where it makes sense for the daily work of an Administrator and Site Builder.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons.

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Have fun building great Breakdance powered sites!!! ;-)
