# Breakdance QuickNav

![Breakdance QuickNav plugin in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deckerweb/breakdance-quicknav/master/assets-github/breakdance-quicknav-screenshot.png)

The **Breakdance QuickNav** plugin adds a quick-access navigator to the WordPress Admin Bar (Toolbar). It allows easy access to Breakdance Builder Templates, Headers, Footers, Global Blocks, Popups, and (regular WordPress) Pages edited with Breakdance, along with other essential settings.

### Tested Compatibility
- **Breakdance Pro**: 2.3.0+ / 2.4.0 Beta
- **WordPress**: 6.7.2 / 6.8 Beta
- **PHP**: 8.0 â€“ 8.3

_Note:_ This plugin was originally developed by [Peter KulcsÃ¡r](https://github.com/beamkiller) under the name ["Breakdance Navigator"](https://github.com/beamkiller/breakdance-navigator). Since it is licensed GPL v2 or later, I decided to fork it to add some more/other links and tweak some things. â€“ If you like the original version, fine! Use it and support the original author!

## Installation

#### **Quick Install â€“ as Plugin**
1. **Download ZIP:** [**breakdance-quicknav.zip**](https://github.com/deckerweb/breakdance-quicknav/releases/latest/download/breakdance-quicknav.zip)
2. Upload via WordPress Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
3. Once activated, youâ€™ll see the **BD** menu item in the Admin Bar.

#### **Alternative: Use as Code Snippet**
1. Below, download the appropriate snippet version
2. activate or deactivate in your snippets plugin

[**Download .json**](https://github.com/deckerweb/oxygen-quicknav/releases/latest/download/ddw-breakdance-quicknav.code-snippets.json) version for: _Code Snippets_ (free & Pro), _Advanced Scripts_ (Premium), _Scripts Organizer_ (Premium)
--> just use their elegant script import features
--> in _Scripts Organizer_ use the "Code Snippets Import"

For all other snippet manager plugins just use our plugin's main .php file [`breakdance-quicknav.php`](https://github.com/deckerweb/breakdance-quicknav/blob/master/breakdance-quicknav.php) and use its content as snippet (bevor saving your snippet: please check for your plugin if the opening php tag needs to be removed or not!).

--> Please decide for one of both alternatives!

#### Minimum Requirements 
* WordPress version 6.7 or higher
* PHP version 7.4 or higher (better 8.3+)
* MySQL version 8.0 or higher / OR MariaDB 10.1 or higher
* Administrator user with capability `manage_options` and `activate_plugins`

## Differences

**What Does "Breakdance QuickNav" _Different_ than "Breakdance Navigator"?**

_Good question, hehe :-)_

### 1) Intended usage for Administrator users only!
Therefore the default capability to see the new Admin Bar node is set to `activate_plugins`. You can change this via the constant `BDQN_VIEW_CAPABILITY` â€“ define that via `wp-config.php` or via a Code Snippet plugin:
```
define( 'BDQN_VIEW_CAPABILITY', 'edit_posts' );
```

### 2) Shorter name of main menu item in Admin Bar, just named "BD".
This is way shorter than "Breakdance Nav" and takes much less of the precious space there. However, if you don't enjoy "BD" you can tweak that also via the constant `BDQN_NAME_IN_ADMINBAR` â€“ define that also via `wp-config.php` or via a Code Snippet plugin:
```
define( 'BDQN_NAME_IN_ADMINBAR', 'BD Nav' );
```

### 3) Default icon of main menu item pulled directly from Breakdance plugin.
The yellow default logo icon is awesome but a bit too yellow-ish for my taste â€“ at least within the Admin Bar. Therefore I pull in the builder icon intended for dark mode (light logo on dark background). If that is not there for whatever reason it pulls in Peter's yellow icon (in local plugin folder). You can also tweak that via a constant in `wp-config.php` oder via a Code Snippets plugin:
```
define( 'BDQN_ICON', 'yellow' );
```

### 4) Adjust the number of displayed Templates/ Pages.
The default number of displayed Templates/ Pages got increased to 20 (instead of 10). That means up to 20 items, starting from latest (newest) down to older ones. And, now you can adjust that value via constant in `wp-config.php` or via a Code Snippets plugin:
```
define( 'BDQN_NUMBER_TEMPLATES', 5 );
```
In that example it would only display up to 5 items. NOTE: just add the number no quotes around it.

### 5) Increased plugin support.
The supported plugins are increased compared to Peters original plugin. The "WPSix Exporter" is now supported by default. All supported plugins are checked if they are active or not.
_Please note:_ I will ONLY add support for direct Breakdance add-on plugins. And I can only add support if I would own a license myself (for testing etc.). Therefore if there might be Breakdance plugins you want me to add integration for, please open an issue on the plugin page on GitHub so we might discuss that. (Thanks in advance!)

### 6) Disable footer items (Links & About)
To disable these menu items, just use another constant in `wp-config.php` or via a Code Snippets plugin:
```
define( 'BDQN_DISABLE_FOOTER', 'yes' );
```

### 7) Updated links.
I carefully updated the links from the Breakdance community, including plugin/ library/ tutorial sites.

### 8) Show Admin Bar also in Block Editor full screen mode.
This an annoyance with WordPress default: the fullscreen mode isn't fullscreen anyways, however, it should at least show the Admin Bar as it makes total sense in this case. â€“ Now it finally does! (since plugin version v1.1.0)

### 9) Alternate Install: Snippet Version!
You can use this "plugin" also as Code Snippet in your favorite snippet manager plugin. See here under ["Installation"](#installation)!

### 10) Other tweaks.
a) There is another check for Breakdance plugin itself: if no Breakdance active then the whole Admin Bar addition is NOT loaded and displayed. Makes sense.

b) If for whatever reason you have already "Breakdance Navigator" installed and ACTIVATED, my plugin (Breakdance QuickNav) will not display anything (even if activated). So it makes sense you decide for one or the other ... ðŸ™‚

## How this Plugin Works

1. **Pages, Templates, Headers, Footers, Global Blocks, Popups**: Displays up to 10 items, ordered by the last modified date (descending). The "Pages" menu only shows pages built with Breakdance by checking the `_breakdance_data` custom field.
2. **Form Submissions, Design Library, Settings**: Direct links to relevant sections.
3. **Additional Links**: Includes links to resources like the Breakdance website and Facebook group. Some may contain affiliate links.
4. **About**: Includes links to the plugin author.

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is. I have no intention to add support for every little detail / third-party plugin / library etc. Its main focus is support for the template types and Breakdance settings. Plugin support is added where it makes sense for the daily work of an Administrator and Site Builder.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons.

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Have fun building great Breakdance powered sites!!! ;-)
